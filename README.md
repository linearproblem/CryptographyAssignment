# CryptographyAssignment
Basic Cryptography assignment using C code

Simple console C application written to encrypt and decrypt text from a user given file. Text is encrypted and decrypted using either a rotation cipher (also called a Ceasar Cipher) or by using a Substitution Cipher. 

## Getting Started

You will need a key and some text to encrypt/decrypt before using this application. 


### Prerequisites

Compadible GCC compiler.

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```


## Using the Program

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Rotation Cipher

key must be between 0 and 26.

```
e.g if key = 3

inputText = "Hello world"
outputText = ""

```


### Substitution Cipher

Key value should be given as unique characters between A-Z and/or a-z
if 'a' is used 'A' should not be used

```
e.g if key = "QWERTYUIOPAZSXDCFVGBHNJMKL"
inputText = "Hello world"
outputText = "ITZZD JDVZR"
```
### Input Text
To use this cipher you are able to input text into the console or via a file (in the same directory as main.c)
